# Setting Up Stuff & Computer System Overview

## Introduction:

Quickly lets do a recap of the few things we did last time.

1. We got introduced to the computer system.

2. We understood how the computer system works internally.

## Today's Lesson:

Today we will focus on Mobile System Organization & the different types of software we use in our day to day lives.

## Computer System Overview (Chapter - 1):

### Mobile System Organization:
 The mordern mobile system that we use is a very complex computer system that is in a hand held formfactor. This is possible due to its carefully designed & configured internals. Althouth they have less compute power as compared to the computer systems but the amount of compute they pack is enough for the tasks we perform. To understand the system we will look at each and every component of the Mobile System to understand how it functions.

A mobile system’s CPU handles diverse types of applications but has a little power compared to computers as mobile system run on battery power.

1. Mobile Processor: This is the brain of a smart phone. The CPU receives commands, makes instant calculations, plays audio/video, stores information and send signals throughout the device. The CPU of a mobile system has majorly two sub processors
types: i) Communication Processing Unit (CPU) ii) Application Processing Unit (APU).

2. Display System: Is responsible for providing display facilities and touch sensitive interface.

3. Camera System: This sub unit is designed to deliver a tightly bound image processing packages and enable an improved over all picture and video experiences.

4. Mobile System Memory: A mobile system also needs memory to work. It comprises of two types of memories RAM and ROM.

5. Storage: The external storage of a mobile system is also called expandable storage. It comes in the form of SD cards, or micro SD cards etc.

6. Power Management Subsystem: This subsystem is responsible for providing power to a mobile system. The mobile system works on limited power provided through an attached battery unit.

### Types of Software:
A computer system consists of hardware and software for its proper functioning. Software can be classified broadly into two categories: a) System Software b) Application Software.

1. System Software: The software that controls internal computer operations. The system software can further be classified into two categories: Operating System and Language Processors.

2. Application Software: Is a set of programs necessary to carry out operations for a specified applications. Application software can further be sub divided into four categories:
    
    i.  Packages: Application software are required to make the computer useful for people. Some major and most common categories of general application software (Packages) are Word processing software, Spreadsheets, DBMS, Desktop Publishing software, Graphics, multimedia and presentation software.

    ii. Utilities: Are those application programs that assists the computer by performing housekeeping functions like backing up disk or scanning, Cleaning viruses or arranging information, Disk defragmenter, Compression utility etc.

    iii. Customized software: This type of software is tailor made software according to user’s requirement. Examples are Inventory Management system, Payroll system, Financial Accounting etc.

    iv. Developer Tools: Software libraries are sets of prewritten code/function/classes etc. available to programmers for use in the development of new code. For example Python comes equipped with many software libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Panda Library.

## Ending Today:

Well that was quite a lot that we learnt today about Types of software and Mobile System Organization .Try to make some key pointers from the video in a notebook that would help you remember all the things we learnt today. If you don't understand anything in this video do ping me in the comments or use many of our social links to get in touch with us.
