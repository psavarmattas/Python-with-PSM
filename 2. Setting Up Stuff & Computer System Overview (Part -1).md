# Setting Up Stuff & Computer System Overview

## Introduction:

Okay so you are here, that means that you are keen in learning Python. That's good to know. Quickly lets do a recap of the few things we did last time. 

1. We installed our Python Interpreter (preferably Visual Studio Code if not don't worry it's fine ).

2. We installed our Python Environment Container (preferably Anaconda Navigator if you have Pycharm or Visual Studio Code but don't install if you install the Python.org interpreter).

3. We have a decent laptop/PC to work on with a decent internet connection.

## Today's Lesson:

Today we will be setting up Visual Studio Code to our liking so that it works correctly with Python & Start learning about computer systems to give them an overview

## Tweaking Some Settings:

If you don't have Visual Studio Code then go right ahead to the timestamp mentioned in the description or shown right here. But if you have installed Visual Studio Code then watch this part really nicely as we would set-up Visual studio Code to work nicely with our beloved Python Code. Okay here we go

1. Open Visual Studio Code and go to the extensions tab on the left hand corner.

2. Install the following extensions:

    a. [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

    b. [Python Docstring Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)

    c. [Rainbow Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=voldemortensen.rainbow-tags)

    d. [Rainbow Brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets)

    e. [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

    f. [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)

    g. Anaconda Extension Pack

3. Restart Visual Studio Code so that these extensions can be fully installed and work as intended.

That's it, all the settings are now tweaked to our liking. Now is the time to start learning the basics about the computer systems we are working on.

## Computer System Overview (Chapter - 1):

### 1.1 - Introduction:

Computers are the machines that have revolutionised the world around us. The way we used to live around 25-30 years ago is very different from how we live today. A modern age student cannot even imagine life, without email, Internet, print outs, playing music on computers or smartphones, photos just a click away in the form of smartphones and so on. In short, in every aspect of life around us, we see computers play a role directly or indirectly.

Computers deliver so much, diligently and efficiently, all thanks to the wonderful combination of their hardware and software.

1. Hardware: The physical electronic components of a computer are called hardware, e.g.. keyboard, CPU, monitor, printer etc. 

2. Software: These are the recorded instructions and programs that govern the working of a computer. Recall that a program is a set of instructions to carry out a specific task or achieve a special work goal.

In this video, we shall discuss computer's functioning in a broad sense by discussing computer system organisation and how various types of software aid in a computer's overall performance.

### 1.2 - BASIC COMPUTER ORGANIZATION

Computer organisation refers to the logical structure of a computer describing how its components are connected to one another ; how they affect one another's functioning, and contribute to overall performance of the computer.

Computers, as you must be knowing, follow the 'IPO' principle i.e., Input -> Process -> Output (a certain input is processed to generate specific output). So, the computer organisation is also like this - these are component(s) dedicated to obtain input in different forms, component(s) dedicated to perform processing and component(s) to produce output in different forms.

Thus basic computer organisation is as shown in this figure right here.

<img align="left" alt="Basic Computer Organization" src="https://github.com/psavarmattas/Python-with-PSM/blob/master/Images/Basic%20Computer%20Organization.jpeg?raw=true">

Let us now talk about these functional components of a computer one by one.

#### 1.2.1 - Input Unit

The input unit is formed by the input devices attached to the computer. Examples of input devices and media are : keyboard, mouse, magnetic ink character reader (MICR), optical mark reader (OMR), optical character reader (OCR), joystick etc.

The input unit is responsible for taking input and converting it into computer understandable form (the binary code). Since a computer operates on electricity, it can understand only the language of electricity i.e., either ON or OFF or high voltage or low voltage. That means a computer can understand two stages ON/OFF or High/Low voltage or the binary language that uses just two symbols : 1 for ON and 0 for OFF.

The input unit is comprised of different input devices that take the input in different forms and pass them in digital form to CPU for processing,

Some common input devices are:

1.  Keyboard: Keyboard is a typewriter like device which is used to type in the letters, digits and commands.

2. Mouse: Mouse is a pointing device with either a roller on its base or some laser mechanism. Mouse controls movement of the pointer (also called mouse pointer) on screen.

3. Microphone (Mic): We can send sound input to a computer through a special input device called microphone or mic in short. A mic converts the sound received into the computer's format, which is called digitised sound or digital audio. A mic can work if your computer has a special hardware known as a sound card.

#### 1.2.2 - Output Unit

The output unit is formed by the output devices attached to the computer. The output coming from the CPU is in the form Output Unit converts the output in binary form to human readable form of electronic binary signals which needs conversion in some form which can be easily understood by human beings ice, characters, graphical or audio visual form. This function of conversion is performed by output units.
Some popular output devices are:

1. Monitors: Monitor (or "screen") is the most common form of output from a computer. It displays information in a similar way to that shown on a television screen. The picture on a monitor is made up of thousands of tiny coloured dots called pixels.

2. Printers: Printers are the devices that deliver information by means of printed characters on paper.

3. Speakers: Speakers receive the sound in form of electric current from the sound card and then convert it to sound format audible to the user.

#### 1.2.3 - CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU or the Central Processing Unit is the main control centre and processing unit. It is also called the brain of the computer as it guides, directs, controls and governs the performance computer. The CPU has some sub-components that help in carrying out the processing of a task. These are:

    a. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

    b. Control Unit (CU)

    c. Registers

Now let me explain each one by one.

1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU performs all the four arithmetic (+,-,*,/) and some logical (<,> ,= ,<=,>= , !=) operations. When two numbers are required to be added, these numbers are sent from memory to ALU where addition takes place and the result is put back in the memory. In the same way, other arithmetic operations are performed (through ALU only). For logical operations also, the numbers to be compared are sent from memory to ALU where the comparison takes place and the result is returned to the memory. The result of a logical operation is either TRUE or FALSE. These operations provide the capability of decision-making to the computer.

2. Control Unit (CU): The CU controls and guides the interpretation, flow and manipulation of all data and information. The CU sends control signals until the required operations are done properly by ALU and memory. Another important function of CU is the program execution i.e., carrying out all the instructions stored in the program. The CU gets program instructions from memory and executes them one after the other. After getting the instructions from memory in CU, the instruction is decoded and interpreted i.e. which operation is to be performed. Then the asked operation is carried out. After the work of this instruction is completed, the control unit sends a signal to memory to send the next instruction in sequence to CU. The control unit even controls the flow of data from input devices to memory and from to output devices.

3. Registers: Registers or processor registers are small units of data holding places. The CPU uses registers to temporarily hold some important processing-information during the time the processing is taking place. CPU may store some part data or some memory address or some instruction in its processor registers.

#### 1.2.4 - The Memory [Main Memory/Primary Memory]

The memory of a computer is more like a predefined working place, where it temporarily keeps information and data to facilitate its performance. Each memory location has a unique memory address. When the task is performed, it clears its memory and memory space is then available for the next task to be performed. When the power is switched off, everything stored in the memory gets erased and cannot be recalled. The memory of a computer can be thought of as 'cells'. Each of these cells is further broken down into smaller parts known as bits (see the figure below). A bit means a binary digit i.e., either 0 or 1. A number of bits together are used to store data instructions by their combination.

<img align="left" alt="Memory Cells" src="https://github.com/psavarmattas/Python-with-PSM/blob/master/Images/Memory%20Cells.jpeg?raw=true">


_A bit is an elementary unit of memory. Eight bits together form a byte. One byte is the smallest unit which can represent a data item or a character. Other units of memory are KB, MB, GB, TB. Every higher memory unit is equal to 210 of its lower unit._

<img align="left" alt="Unit Conversion Table of Memory" src="https://github.com/psavarmattas/Python-with-PSM/blob/master/Images/Unit%20Conversion%20Table%20of%20Memory.png?raw=true">


Since a computer's main memory (primary memory) is temporary, secondary memory space is needed to store data and information permanently for later use. Some most common secondary storage media are the hard disk, CD-RWs, pen drive etc. The secondary memory devices are also known as storage devices.

##### 1.2.4A - Parts of Main Memory/Primary Memory

In the random-access memory (RAM), the memory cells can be accessed for information transfer from any desired random location. That is, the process of locating a word in memory is the same and requires an equal amount of memory, thus the name "random access". The main drawback of RAM memory is that it is a volatile memory. That is, when the power goes off, the contents of RAM get erased.

The RAM chips in a computer can be of two basic types:

1. Dynamic RAM (DRAM): These are made up of transistors and capacitors. The amount of time taken to produce data required from memory, from the start of access until the availability of data is called memory access time. Today's DRAM chips have access times ranging from below 20 to 70 nanoseconds.

2. Static RAM: These are made up of flip-flops and offer faster access times (about 10 nanoseconds) than DRAMs. Static RAMs are thus used in specialised applications while dynamic RAMs are used in the primary storage sections of most computers.

#### Read Only Memory (ROM)

As the name implies, a read-only memory (ROM) is a memory unit that performs the read operation only; it does not have a write capability. This implies that the binary information stored in a ROM is made permanent during the hardware production of the unit and cannot be altered by writing different words into it (hence non-volatile). Whereas a RAM is a general purpose device whose contents can be altered during the computational process, a ROM is restricted to reading words that are permanently stored within the unit. ROMs are used for applications in which it is known that the information never needs to be altered, for example, a monitor program controlling a machine. These, however, are slower than RAM.

There are various types of ROM which are given below:

1. PROM (programmable ROM): Also called OTP (One Time Programmable). PROM is a user-programmable memory in which information is burnt using special equipment called a ROM burner.

2. EPROM (erasable programmable ROM): In EPROM, one can program the memory chip (through various mechanisms e.g., UV radiation) and erase it many times as needed. The UV-EPROM can take up to 20 minutes for erasing EPROM contents.

3. EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable ROM): In EEPROM, the EPROM is erased electrically which is faster. Also, with EEPROM, selective bytes can be erased unlike UV-EPROM which erases fully.

4. Flash EEPROM: It is like EEPROM but is very fast comparatively (the erasure of the entire contents takes less than a second). Also, it erases fully and not selectively.

5. Mask ROM: Mask ROM refers to a kind of ROM in which the contents are programmed by the IC manufacturer. It is not a user-programmable ROM.

#### 1.2.5 - The Storage Unit

Computers need to store and retrieve data for processing. Since primary memory has a limited storage capacity and is not permanent, secondary storage devices are used to store large amounts of data permanently. There are various types of secondary devices available these days.

To specify the storage capacity of storage devices, the same units of memory are used, which are used for measuring primary memory. That is, we can represent the storage capacity of storage devices in terms of kilobytes (KBs), mega bytes (MB), giga bytes (GBs) and terabytes (TBs) as we do for main memory.

Let us now talk about some most common storage devices:

1. Hard Disks: The hard disk memories store information on one or more circular platters (or disks) which are continually spinning. These rotating disks are coated with a magnetic material and stacked with space between them. Information is recorded on the surface of rotating disks by magnetic heads as tiny magnetic spots. The hard disks of today have storage capacity measured in gigabytes to terabytes.

2. Compact Disks (CDs): The compact disks or CDs are optical media. CDs have a relatively cheap capacity of upto 700 Mb. There are three main types of CDs :

    a. CD-ROM (Compact Disk-Read Only Memory): This is used only to store information and cannot be used to store data. It is mainly used for CD distribution e.g., encyclopaedias, software, games, e-books etc.

    b. CD-R (Compact Disk-Recordable): It is mainly used for CD-R and can be written on only once and the disk can't be erased.

    c. CD-RW (Compact Disk-Rewritable): CD-RW is an erasable disk you can write on multiple times.

3. DVDs: DVD is an optical storage device that looks the same as a compact disc but is able hold about 15 times as much information and transfer it to the computer about 20 times as fast as a CD-ROM. A DVD, also called a Super Density disk (SD), can hold upto 17 gigabytes of data or four hours of movies on a side. DVDs also come in three varieties.

    a. DVD-ROM. This is read only on DVDs i.e., once recorded initially, you cannot write on it.
    
    b. DVD-R (DVD-Recordable). DVD-R similar to CD-R's allows users to write on the disc once but read it many times.

    c. DVD-RW (DVD-Rewritable). Most writable DVD drives are DVD-RW You can erase and read many times on them.

4. Flash Memory: A flash drive is a small, ultra-portable storage device with a 'solid state' memory i.e., it has no moving parts unlike magnetic storage devices, nor does it make use of lasers - unlike optical drives. Instead, it works in a similar way to RAM. The key difference is that data is retained in Flash memory even when the power is switched off. They are now fairly inexpensive, costing from 250/- upwards. Typical sizes range from 256 Mbytes up to 128 GB and beyond.

5. Blu Ray Disk: Blu-ray Disc (also known as Blu-ray or BD) is an optical disc storage media format. Its main uses are high-definition video and data storage. The disc has the same dimensions as a standard DVD or CD. While current optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM rely on a red laser to read and write data, the new format uses a blue-violet laser instead, hence the name Blu-ray. The benefit of using a blue-violet laser (405 nm) is that it has a shorter wavelength than a red laser (650 nm), which makes it possible to focus the laser spot with even greater precision. This allows data to be packed more tightly and stored in less space, so it's possible to fit more data on the disc even though it's the same size as a CD/DVD. Blu Ray discs of today are capable of storing up to 128 GB of data.

#### 1.2.6 - The System Bus

The system bus (or the bus) is an electronic pathway composed of connecting cables that connects the major components of a computer system. Through the system bus, data and instructions are passed among the computer system components.

1. The data carrying part of a system bus is called a data bus.

2. The control instruction carrying part of the system bus is called control bus.

3. The memory address carrying part of the system bus is called Address bus.

4. A separate type of bus called I/O Bus connects the Input, Output and other external devices to the system.
