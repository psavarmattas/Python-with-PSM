# Setting Up Stuff & Computer System Overview (Part - 1)

## Introduction:

Okay so you are here, that means that you are keen in learning Python. That's good to know. Quickly lets do a recap of the few things we did last time. 

1. We installed our Python Interpreter (preferably Visual Studio Code if not don't worry it's fine ).

2. We installed our Python Environment Container (preferably Anaconda Navigator if you have Pycharm or Visual Studio Code but don't install if you install the Python.org interpreter).

3. We have a decent laptop/PC to work on with a decent internet connection.

## Today's Lesson:

Today we will be setting up Visual Studio Code to our liking so that it works correctly with Python & Start learning about computer systems to give them an overview

## Tweaking Some Settings:

If you don't have Visual Studio Code then go right ahead to the timestamp mentioned in the description or shown right here. But if you have installed Visual Studio Code then watch this part really nicely as we would set-up Visual studio Code to work nicely with our beloved Python Code. Okay here we go

1. Open Visual Studio Code and go to the extensions tab on the left hand corner.

2. Install the following extensions:

    a. [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

    b. [Python Docstring Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)

    c. [Rainbow Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=voldemortensen.rainbow-tags)

    d. [Rainbow Brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets)

    e. [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

    f. [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)

    g. Anaconda Extension Pack

3. Restart Visual Studio Code so that these extensions can be fully installed and work as intended.

That's it all the settings are now tweaked to our liking. Now is the time to start learning the basics about the computer systems we are working on.

## Computer System Overview (Chapter - 1):

### 1.1 - Introduction:

Computers are the machines that have revolutionised the world around us. The way we used to live around 25-30 years ago is very different from how we live today. A modern age student cannot even imagine life, without email, Internet, print outs, playing music on computers or smartphones, photos just a click away in the form of smartphones and so on. In short, in every aspect of life around us, we see computers play a role directly or indirectly.

Computers deliver so much, diligently and efficiently, all thanks to the wonderful combination of their hardware and software.

1. Hardware: The physical electronic components of a computer are called hardware, e.g.. keyboard, CPU, monitor, printer etc. 

2. Software: These are the recorded instructions and programs that govern the working of a computer. Recall that a program is a set of instructions to carry out a specific task or achieve a special work goal.

In this video, we shall discuss computer's functioning in a broad sense by discussing computer system organization and how various types of software aid in computer's overall performance.

### 1.2 - BASIC COMPUTER ORGANIZATION

Computer organization refers to the logical structure of a computer describing how its components are connected to one another ; how they affect one another's functioning, and contribute to overall performance of the computer.

Computers, as you must be knowing, follow the 'IPO' principle i.e., Input -> Process -> Output (a certain input is processed to generate specific output). So, the computer organization is also like this - these are component(s) dedicated to obtain input in different forms, component(s) dedicated to perform processing part and component(s) to produce output in different forms.

Thus basic computer organization is as shown in this figure right here.

Let us now talk about these functional components of a computer one by one.

#### 1.2.1 - Input Unit

The input unit is formed by the input devices attached to the computer. Examples of input devices and media are : keyboard, mouse, magnetic ink character reader (MICR), optical mark reader (OMR), optical character reader (OCR), joystick etc.

The input unit is responsible for taking input and converting it into computer understandable form (the binary code). Since a computer operates on electricity, it can understand only the language of electricity i.e., either ON or OFF or high voltage or low voltage. That means a computer can understand two stages ON/OFF or High/Low voltage or the binary language that uses just two symbols : 1 for ON and 0 for OFF.

The input unit is comprised of different input devices that take the input in different forms and pass them in digital form to CPU for processing,

Some common input devices are:

1.  Keyboard: Keyboard is a typewriter like device which is used to type in the letters, digits and commands.

2. Mouse: Mouse is a pointing device with either a roller on its base or some laser mechanism. Mouse controls movement of the pointer (also called mouse pointer) on screen.

3. Microphone (Mic): We can send sound input to a computer through a special input device called microphone or mic in short. A mic converts the sound received into computer's format, which is called digitized sound or digital audio. A mic can work if your computer has a special hardware known as sound card.

#### 1.2.2 - Output Unit

The output unit is formed by the output devices attached to the computer. The output coming from the CPU is in the form Output Unit converts the output in binary form to human readable form of electronic binary signals which needs conversion in some form which can be easily understood by human beings ice, characters, graphical or audio visual form. This function of conversion is performed by output units.
Some popular output devices are:

1. Monitors: Monitor (or "screen") is the most common form of output from a computer. It displays information in a similar way to that shown on a television screen. The picture on a monitor is made up of thousands of tiny coloured dots called pixels.

2. Printers: Printers are the devices that deliver information by means of printed characters on paper.

3. Speakers: Speakers receive the sound in form of electric current from the sound card and then convert it to sound format audible to the user.

#### 1.2.3 - CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU or the Central Processing Unit is the main control centre and processing unit. It is also called the brain of the computer as it guides, directs, controls and governs the performance computer. The CPU has some sub-components that help in carrying out the processing of a task. These are:

    a. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

    b. Control Unit (CU)

    c. Registers

Now let me explain each one by one.

1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU performs all the four arithmetic (+,-,*,/) and some logical (<,> ,= ,<=,>= , !=) operations. When two numbers are required to be added, these numbers are sent from memory to ALU where addition takes place and the result is put back in the memory. In the same way, other arithmetic operations are performed (through ALU only). For logical operations also, the numbers to be compared are sent from memory to ALU where the comparison takes place and the result is returned to the memory. The result of a logical operation is either TRUE or FALSE. These operations provide the capability of decision-making to the computer.

2. Control Unit (CU): The CU controls and guides the interpretation, flow and manipulation of all data and information. The CU sends control signals until the required operations are done properly by ALU and memory. Another important function of CU is the program execution i.e., carrying out all the instructions stored in the program. The CU gets program instructions from memory and executes them one after the other. After getting the instructions from memory in CU, the instruction is decoded and interpreted i.e. which operation is to be performed. Then the asked operation is carried out. After the work of this instruction is completed, the control unit sends a signal to memory to send the next instruction in sequence to CU. The control unit even controls the flow of data from input devices to memory and from to output devices.

3. Registers: Registers or processor registers are small units of data holding places. The CPU uses registers to temporarily hold some important processing-information during the time the processing is taking place. CPU may store some part data or some memory address or some instruction in its processor registers.
