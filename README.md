# Learn Python with a side of Fun!

## Introduction:

Hello and welcome to I think your 10th try to learn Python on YouTube and at this point you think will this person or this YouTube channel help me actually study and learn Python language with a little fun. Guess what my friends you are at the correct destination and wait on further I can help you understand from the very basic level to the top with which you can actually do many things like creating fully working apps to gaming and automation of your favourite tasks using Python. At the end for this series your imagination will be the limit of what you can create.

_Skip the '1. Hello & Welcome.md' if you read the'README.md' fully._

## Watch Our Video:

If you want you can also watch our [video course on Python here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWfwhmpFdhZBQ6ZX6um4pkgEgP-wPEsQX) to get a better understanding on [how to get started with Python](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWfwhmpFdhZBQ6ZX6um4pkgEgP-wPEsQX)

## Briefing of Python:

So what is Python, basically Python coding language is just any other coding language except for one little thing Python by code and by understanding is a lot shorter and simpler to execute via code.

## Pre-Requisites:

A lot has been said about Python coding and its understandings but when are we starting is the question in your mind. We are starting with the course fro our next video but before we even start we have to do a little thing there and a little thing there to make it all work seamlessly.

1. Python Interpreter (Pycharm, Visual Studio).

2. Python Environment Container (Anaconda Navigator).

3. A decent laptop/PC to work on with a decent internet connection.

## Myself...

That's it so here we end our introduction and from our next video you will start writing and executing some Python code. BTW if you didn't catch my name I'm Puranjay Savar Mattas.
